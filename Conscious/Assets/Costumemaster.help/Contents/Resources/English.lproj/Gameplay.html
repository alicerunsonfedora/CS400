    <h2 class="header">How to play The Costumemaster</h2>
    <p>The Costumemaster is a puzzle game where you switch between costumes and activate different input devices to open
        the exit door and leave each level.</p>

    <a name="Gameplay_GOAL"></a>
    <h3 class="header">Objective</h3>
    <p>In each level of The Costumemaster, the player must successfully be able to reach the exit door. The exit door
        must be opened by a set of inputs that must be activated. In some scenarios, the player may need to switch
        between different costumes to unlock different abilities.</p>

        or what costume the player is wearing.</p>
