    <h2 class="header">Using the AI Simulator Tool</h2>
    <p>The Costumemaster comes with a tool dedicated to running simulations with artificial intelligence, the <b>AI
            Simulator Tool</b>.</p>
    <img src="../shared/aisim.png" />
    <a name="AISimulation_TOOL"></a>
    <h3 class="header">Using the Simulator Tool</h3>
    <p>To test the agents in a sample level for AI, open The Costumemaster and go to <strong>Game &rsaquo; Run AI
            Simulation...</strong>
        or press ⌘R on your keyboard to open the AI Simulator tool. The AI simulator tool allows you to select an agent
        type, move
        generation rate, and level for the simulator.</p>
    <p>Apply the settings you wish to use and then click &quot;Start Simulation&quot; to run the simulation. The game
        window will play the level selected in the Simulator and a console window will appear.</p>

    <a name="AISimulation_PREF"></a>
    <h3 class="header">Configuring the Simulator</h3>
    <img src="../shared/aisimtool.png" class="smaller" />
    <p>There are multiple settings that can be configured in the Simulator Tool before running a simulation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Run simulation with agent</b> - The type of agent to use in the simulation. When changed, the description
            above will
            change so that information about that agent is present. </li>
        <li><b>Run simulation in level</b> - The level to run the simulation in. Some are special levels for agents to
            use, while others are the regular levels from the game. </li>
        <li><b>Limit move generation per batch to</b> - How many moves should be made at a given time during the
            simulation. The agent will perform actions in a batch of moves; defining this number will determine how many
            moves are made in a given batch before re-assessing the state and making the next batch.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="AISimulation_CONSOLE"></a>
    <h3 class="header">View messages with the Simulator Console</h3>
    <p>The AI Simulator Console displays messages from the simulation as the simulation progresses. These messages can
        be used to analyze the agent's actions and its next likely moves.</p>

    <img src="../shared/aisimconsole.png" alt="AI Simulator Console" />

    <p>Messages sent to the console are also reflected in the command line if launched from the Terminal, with the
        exception of debug
        messages. If the console is closed, the console can be re-opened by going to <strong>Game &rsaquo; AI Simulator
            Console</strong> in the
        menu bar or press ⌥⌘C on your keyboard.</p>

    <h4>Filter console messages</h4>
    <p>By default, the console will display all messages. The Console Filter changes the filter parameters to only
        display specific types of messages.</p>

    <h4>View latest activity with Now Mode</h4>
    <p>Now Mode allows you to view the console messages as a stack, with the most recent message at the top. Click the
        Now Mode
        button in the console toolbar to toggle Now Mode on/off.</p>

    <a name="AISimulation_RECORD"></a>
    <h3 class="header">Record simulations for ML agents</h3>
    <p>
        If you wish to make recordings of playthroughs for machine learning agents to use and learn from, you can run
        the built-in recording tool by going to <b>Game &rsaquo; Record Simulation...</b> or by pressing ⬆⌘R on your
        keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Select the level you want to record by pressing "Play" on the level selection screen.
    </p>
    <h4>Understanding the state recorder tool</h4>
    <img src="../shared/airecordtool.png" alt="AI Simulator Console" />
    <p>
        The State Recorder tool is a utility designed to help make recordings for machine learning agents. The current
        state assessment is displayed, and options to change the action to take are displayed at the bottom. The tool
        supports exporting the recording to a CSV format.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make an action that corresponds to the current state assessment, change the value in "Perform the following
        action:" and click "Submit".
    </p>
    <p>
        To export all of the current assessments and actions to a CSV file, click on the Export CSV button in the
        toolbar.
    </p>
