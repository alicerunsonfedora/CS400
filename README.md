## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to take the concepts from _CS440: Principles of Artificial Intelligence_ and build a better 
understanding of agents and apply these concepts by implementing and comparing agents in a video game.

## Build instructions

### Requirements

- Xcode 11 or higher
- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or higher
- (Optional, but recommended) [SwiftLint][linter]

Clone the Xcode project and then run the `Conscious` scheme to build the project in Xcode.

### About SwiftLint

This project includes support for SwiftLint, a utility that enforces recommended Swift styling practices. While it is not required to install
SwiftLint to build the project, it is highly recommended. The project, during build, will do the following with SwiftLint:

- Resolve any quick, auto-correctable fixes with `swiftlint autocorrect`.
- Run the linter on all source files and present warnings/errors in Xcode after running.

The following practices are also being implemented with SwiftLint:

- Lines should be no longer than 120 characters long, similar to PEP8 standards with Python.
- Function body length will be ignored.
