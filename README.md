**Applied AI with GameplayKit**

An acclaimed costume designer and software engineer wakes up from a blackout to an eerily familiar scene. But, something isn't
quite... right.... Traverse through a dream-like, constantly changing bedroom and office and get out as quickly as you can. Can you
make it out and figure out what's going on?

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to take the concepts from _CS440: Principles of Artificial Intelligence_ and build a better 
understanding of agents and apply these concepts by implementing and comparing agents in a video game.

More information on the objective of this repository can be found in the [design proposal][proposal].

## Roadmap

| Status | Due Date | Milestone |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| üü¢ | September 21, 2020 | Working Game |
| üü° | October 19, 2020 | Adding Apple's agents with GameplayKit |
| üî¥ | November 9, 2020 | Adding custom agents and beating Apple |
| üî¥ | November 16, 2020 | Final presentation and cleanup |

Details on these milestones can be found on the [Milestones page in this repository's issues][milestones].

## Build instructions

### Requirements

- Xcode 12.2* or higher
- macOS 10.15.6 (Catalina) or higher
- [KeyboardShortcuts][keys] (added when cloning)
- (Optional, but recommended) [SwiftLint][linter]

1. Clone the Xcode project and ensure that dependencies are install with the Swift Package Manager.
2. In the project settings, change the bundle identifier to your own bundle identifier (See Game Center, In-App Purchases).
3. Run the **Game** scheme to build the project in Xcode.

To make a release version, click on the destination ("My Mac") and select "Any Mac (Apple Silicon, Intel)", then go to **Product &rsaquo;
Archive**.

<small>*The release version of Xcode 12.0 and the GM seed are not compatible with this project due to the macOS 11 SDK not being
present. To build with Xcode 12.0, you will need to comment out code for GKAccessPoint and GKLeaderboards.</small>

### Game Center

The Costumemaster integrates with Game Center to allow players to earn achievements, challenge others, and rank in the leaderboards
for the best scores on levels (scoring system similar to what AI agents use). Game Center is a service that requires an Apple Developer
account and an app registered in App Store Connect with the bundle identifier of the game. To test Game Center achievements, make
sure that you update the build identifier in the project to the app's identifier in App Store Connect and make sure that the achievements
with the IDs listed in [GameAchievements.swift][gcachieve] in the Achievements list of the Game Center section.

![Game Center](https://github.com/alicerunsonfedora/CS400/raw/root/.readme/gamecenter.png)

To access features like the new access point and leaderboard submission, ensure that Xcode includes at least the macOS 11.0 SDK.

### In-App Purchases

The Costumemaster also integrates with StoreKit to provide in-app purchase support for DLC content such as "Watch Your Step!".
In-app purchases require an Apple Developer account with an app registered in App Store Connect with the bundle identifier of the
game. In-app purchases will need to be configured with the IDs listed in [IAPManager.PurchaseableContent][iapcontent] in App Store
Connect.

### About SwiftLint

This project includes support for SwiftLint, a utility that enforces recommended Swift styling practices. While it is not required to install
SwiftLint to build the project, it is highly recommended. The project, during build, will do the following with SwiftLint:

- Resolve any quick, auto-correctable fixes with `swiftlint autocorrect`.
- Run the linter on all source files and present warnings/errors in Xcode after running.

The following practices are also being implemented with SwiftLint:

- Lines should be no longer than 120 characters long, similar to PEP8 standards with Python.
- Function body length will be ignored.
- Bodies for types should not exceed 400 lines (warnings issued at 250 lines).
- Files should not exceed 1000 lines (warnings issued at 500 lines).
- When possible, avoid making a filtered list and iterating over it; use the `for x in x where y` format instead.

### Documentation

Documentation is handled by [Jazzy][jazzy], a documentation generator provided by Realm. Follow the instructions to build the
documentation:

1. Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies needed. In some cases, you may need to set parameters for installing sqlite3 or for
    installing the Xcode Command Line Tools.
2. Run `docs_build.sh` to build the docs.
